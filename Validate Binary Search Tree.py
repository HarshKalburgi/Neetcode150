# Validate Binary Search Tree
# Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

# A valid BST is defined as follows:

# The left 
# subtree
#  of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
# The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
# Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
