# Daily Temperatures
# Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.
# code

class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures):

                idx = stack.pop()
