# Same Tree

# Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

# Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

# code:

class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p, q):
        # If both nodes are None, they are identical
        if p is None and q is None:
            return True
        # If only one of the nodes is None, they are not identical
        if p is None or q is None:
            return False
        # Check if values are equal and recursively check left and right subtrees
        if p.val == q.val:
            return self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
        # Values are not equal, they are not identical
        return False
